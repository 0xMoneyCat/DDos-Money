## Requirements

- Operating system: Linux, Windows, or macOS  
- Python 3.x or suitable runtime environment (depending on tool version)  
- Proxy (for safer and more effective attacks)

## FAQ

**Q1: Which operating systems are supported?**  
A: The tool runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS, depending on the version.

**Q2: Should I use a proxy?**  
A: For some methods, using proxies is recommended to hide your IP and avoid being blocked.

**Q3: What is the difference between Layer7 and Layer4?**  
A: Layer7 targets the application layer (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS), while Layer4 attacks the transport layer (e.g., TCP, UDP).

**Q4: Why is the code obfuscated?**  
A: Developing a powerful and effective DDoS tool takes a lot of time and effort. If someone could simply steal it with a click, all the work would be pointless. The DDoS tool is provided for free but protected.
